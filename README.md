<h2 align="center">Frameworks Analysis Tool (FAT)</h2>

Frameworks Analysis Tool (FAT) is a tool for analyzing a JavaScript framework with visualizing it, mainly including the whole dependencies between JavaScript files and modules. It aims to generate a dynamic graphic for learning "**fat**" frameworks in a apparent way. Furthermore, as there are already some bundle tools like Webpack or Parcel, which can help us to calculate bundles of our projects, I would like to make this took as a integrated plugin for them to help analyzing. To build such a tool, my journey is long and winding, and I will keep on exploring my way far and wide.

Firstly, Webpack has provided stats data of bundles during compiling and building, which can be stored with JSON formats. With the data, it is helpful for learning relationships between JavaScript files by visualizing them. So, visual function for Webpack is the first step of this tool.
